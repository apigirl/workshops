Now that we benefit from a monitoring from our frontend to our back-end let's be pro-active to reduce further more our MTTR.

Go in Datadog [Synthetics page](https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/list) and enable it by selecting *Get started*.

### API test

First, let's [create an API test](https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/create).

1. As URL enter your application URL: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-5000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/
2. Give you test a name: `Log workshop API test`
2. Click **Test URL**
3. Validate the test by creating **Create test**


This test periodically tries to reach out our application Dashboard from diffrent locations around the world. If it succeed, it then checks the different assertions defined in the test, and upon fail it would send you a notification.

Scroll down you page and select a test results:

![]()

Now select the _Trace_ tab to see the corresponding trace that was generated by your backend for this specific API test, notice that all logs generated by this trace are also displayed alongside the host metrics collected:

![]()

But we can go even more in depth.


### Browser test

Go back to the Synthetics home page, and [create a browser test](https://app.datadoghq.com/synthetics/browser/create):

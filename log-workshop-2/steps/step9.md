Let's build a monitor on our logs that warns us if too many errors occur for a given service:

Enter the search you want to monitor logs from in your Log explorer search bar:

![monitor query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop-2/images/log_query_monitor.png)

Click on the export to monitor button in the upper right corner of the Log explorer page:

![export to monitor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop-2/images/export_to_monitor.png)

Set up a Warning and Alert threshold for your Log monitor, then give your monitor a title and define the notification template:

### Save your monitor.

Check that your monitor is correctly saved in your manage monitor page:

![manage monitor page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop-2/images/manage_monitor_page.png)

### Monitor notification

If you entered your email address in the notification, you should receive an email with a snippet of 10 logs matching your query:

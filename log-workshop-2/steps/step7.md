Since our containers are correctly labeled, the [Datadog-Docker](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/docker) integration and the [Datadog-Redis](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#integrations/redis) integrations are both installed, and their corresponding dashboards are displaying some data:

* [Redis Dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.com/screen/integration/15/redis---overview)

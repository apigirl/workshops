To add an attribute as a Facet and start using it in your log analytics, click on it:

![create facet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop/assets/images/create_facet.png)

Don't forget to assign a group to your facet in order to avoid polluting your Log explorer view:

![create facet group](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop/assets/images/creating_facet_group.png)

You can then use this facet to filter your log explorer view:

![using facet as filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop/assets/images/using_facet_as_filter.png)

Or in your Log analytics:

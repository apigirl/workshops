Let's build a monitor upon our logs that warns us if an error occurs and that send us the corresponding logs:

Enter the search you want to monitor logs from in your Log explorer search bar:

Click on the export to monitor button in the upper right corner of the Log explorer page:

Set up a Warning and Alert threshold for your Log monitor

Set the monitor title and template the notification sent.

If you entered your email address in the notification, you should receive an email with a snippet of 10 logs matching your query:

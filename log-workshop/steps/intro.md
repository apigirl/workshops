Welcome to Logging with Datadog Log Management workshop.

This Katacoda course contains a "dummy" Water System microservices project, a single page web application with microservices, already instrumented and analyzed using Datadog's APM and infrastructure products.

This workshop shows you how log management can reduce your mean time to resolution should you encounter an issue with a given application by giving you the best setup practice and a global tour of Datadog Log Management solution.

Todays objective are to see how to:

* Collect logs from a pre-existing application
* Enable Datadog OOTB Processing capabilities.
* Parse Logs in order to bind them to APM data and make it easier to analyse them.
* Create monitors upon your Log Data.

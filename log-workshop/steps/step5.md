The service tag now allows us to switch between our log explorer view and the corresponding APM service:

![iot frontend switch ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop/assets/images/iot-frontend-switch.png)

Open a log from `iot-frontend` service by clicking on it.

On top of the contextual panel click on the `iot-frontend` Service name.

You should arrive on this page in Datadog APM:

![iot-frontend-service-page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop/assets/images/iot-frontend_service_page.png)

Open the simulate_sensor resource and then any given trace, when switching to the log tab you should see the corresponding logs:

![logs in trace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l0k0ms/workshops/master/log-workshop/assets/images/logs_in_trace.png)

Click on the log to get back to the log explorer view.
